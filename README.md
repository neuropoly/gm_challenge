# Gray Matter Challenge (2018)
Spinal cord gray matter imaging challenge for the 5th Spinal Cord Workshop (June 22<sup>nd</sup>, Paris).

## Getting started

The objective for this challenge is to propose a protocol that will generate the best image quality. For more details,
please see: https://goo.gl/2owcL7.

* [WMGM.py](./WMGM.py): Process data using SCT and compute image quality metrics. More details [here](#analysis).
* [generate_wmgm_phantom.py](./generate_wmgm_phantom.py): generate synthetic phantom of WM and GM to validate the present pipeline.

### Dependencies

- [Spinal Cord Toolbox (SCT)](https://github.com/neuropoly/spinalcordtoolbox)

## Analysis

Two NIfTI files are required: an initial scan and a re-scan without repositioning.

### Pre-processing
- The second image is registered to the first in order to compute the SNR using the two-image subtraction method.
- The spinal cord and gray matter of each image are segmented automatically.
- White matter segmentation is generated by subtracting the gray matter segmentation from the cord segmentation.

### Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR):
  The SNR is computed with SCT using the two-image subtraction method.

### Contrast:
The mean signal is computed in the white matter and gray matter of image 1. The contrast is then computed according to the following equation:

Contrast = abs(mean(WM) - mean(GM)) / min{mean(WM),mean(GM)}

### Sharpness:
The Laplacian is first calculated for image 1. The mean of the Laplacian inside the cord is then computed to give the measure of sharpness for the image.
